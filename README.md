# budget-tracker - Motivation   

Bugdet Tracker is an app which allows the user to enter deposits offline and enter expenses offline. Budget Tracker has the ability to make offline updates when internet connectivity has been restored.

Offline Functionality:
    * Enter deposits offline
    * Enter expenses offline

When brought back online:
    * Offline entries should be added to tracker

## Usage: Visit the deployed Heroku link here: https://young-eyrie-27509.herokuapp.com/

Then, insert the name and amount of your transaction, and select whether or not it will add or subtract from your funds. For example, if you were paid today, you would add that value to your funds.

A chart will render your transactions below.

While offline you may continue to view the application and add transactions.

When internet is detected, your total budget will update based on those transactions.

You can also run "npm i" in your terminal, and once it has finished installing, run "node server.js"
